# InazumaEleven3ScriptEditor
Project created to eventually be able to understand and modify the eve and evet files in the game Inazuma Eleven 3: Team Ogre Attacks

# Credits
This project is an adaptation of a project uploaded by [`@NielsHotweels`](https://github.com/NielsHotweels) to Own Studio Discord at modding-chat, so I'd like to thank and give a great shoutout to him. If you are interested on modding Inazuma Eleven games checkout his [`InazumaDSEditor`](https://github.com/NielsHotweels/InazumaDSEditor) project. Changes were made to adapt the program to the file formats of Inazuma Eleven 3, as well as the way functions are distinguished now (through inheritance).

# Disclaimer
The project is being developed using the spanish fan translation of the game made by [`The Ogre Traduction`](https://twitter.com/ogretraduction), so I can't guarantee that it'll work for other translations of the game or the original.
